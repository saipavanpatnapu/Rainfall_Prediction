## Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning
## Description
This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using historical weather data. It applies multiple machine learning models to compare performance and deploys the final model using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

## ML Models
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
SVM
XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Bar graph Comparison

## Streamlit Web App - Implementation
Run the commands in the CommandPrompt:

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python -m streamlit run app.py
  
Enter Weather Parameters â†’ Get Rainfall Prediction.
